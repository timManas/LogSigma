# LogSigma

Log Sigma is tool which allows employees to automatically track the amount of hours they worked at Office / Store / etc. It accomplishes this by tracking your "Work" Wi-Fi specifically and monitors how many hours you spent on site. Once you leave your work, the app will record the End time and create a text file to log all hours.
You will also receive reminders to export your Log file to your email account for safe keeping. 
No more manually writing down your hours on an excel file.

This App is 100% free and does not involve ads at all. 
You can also view the complete source code on GitHub under "Log Sigma" . Enjoy !
